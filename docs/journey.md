# Journey
This document will be for journal my thoughts related to this project.
I wonder if I should add this to my .gitnore.

### 2021-02-04
- Considering completely rewriting script.js.

### 2024-07-07
- Just started working on this project again a few days ago.
- I've already solved a big UI issue the was one of the reasons why I took such a long break.
  - Color displays now show the color of the result.
- Next, I'll need to build the betting logic.

### 2024-07-09
- So... this is becoming my first practice building something, using git/Github the way it's intended with pull requests, merge requests, and issues. I wished I'd be doing it this way all along. No more wishing. It's time for doing.

### 2024-07-11
- Solved the betting issue. Now I just need to clean up the code I'm not longer using and add some of the other outside bets.
- I'm pretty happy about this accomplishment. It was beginning to become so overwhelming I seriously considered started over from scratch with the Javascript files.
